CodeCamper to HWPCBug Site

First, I had to create a whole new user in the CAT_MSWin81EnterpriseVM
cat8dev@live.com - Time2Invest

Then Install VisualStudio via the DVD Drive D:\VS2013_RTM_ULT_ENU iso 
CATMINI Users\cat\sites\10_Downloads\en_visual_studio_ultimate_2013_x86_dvd_3175319.iso
(had to get cat8deve (admin on CAT_MSWin81Enterprise) permission to install… so have no clue if the same bits are shared)

Fire VS2013 up and copy over CC.Web in build-apps-angular-breeze-part2\10-build-apps-angular-breeze-part2-m9-exercise-file\after\CC.Web to
C:\Users\cat8d_000\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\CC.Web

http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/ExerciseFiles/build-apps-angular-breeze-part2 plural sight source
Note: the hot towel series leading to this...
1 - Single Page Apps JumpStart 
2 - Building Apps with Angular and Breeze - Part 1
3 - Building Apps with Angular and Breeze - Part 2

Open Solution, Build (twice once to get the NuGet to load, once to get a clean build)
Launch…. Looks as expected.

So let make sure we can build the db connection.  I had lots of issues with CE so I want to remove all of that from WebConfig… but not sure

Add EntityFramework via NuGet Package Manager…
Add Order.cs with simple structure

Add a new table
===========
Add - CC.Model\Order.cs (Description of structure)
Add - CC.Web\Controllers\BreezeController.cs (line 53) (Structure of API return)
        [HttpGet]
        public IQueryable<Order> Orders()
        {
            return _repository.Orders;
        }
Add - CC.DataAccess\CodeCamperDbContext.cs (EF trigger to create the table)
        public DbSet<Order> Orders { get; set; }
Add - CC.DataAccess\CodeCamperRepository.cs (EF reflection of API return)
        public IQueryable<Order> Orders
        {
            get { return Context.Orders; }
        }
Add - CC.Web\app\services\datacontext.js (line 19) (Setup the repo name)
Prime the table (if needed) by calling in the prime function (line 104)
Add order to entity Names in model.js (line 24) (create client side entity)
register order to metadataStore in model.js (line 42) (suck the structure from metadata)
write function registerOrder (line 103)
Create and add repository.order.js and add to index.html (setup so client can access via repo pattern)

The iteration for db init became:
Delete App_Data/CodeCamper.sdf
Delete DataContexts/OrderDbMigrations/ (all migrations.cs)
Edit Configurations.cs to put in seed data you are working on
PM> add-migration -ConfigurationTypeName CC.Web.DataContexts.OrderDbMigrations.Configuration "Initial Create"
PM> update-database -Verbose

Now add the navigation and view into client side stuff
=========
Add the View Model (copy order structure and rename to ticket)
Add the 3 (ticket, ticket detail, ticket search) Navigation config.route.js
Add controllers js to index.html


----- OLDER NOTES -----

Now Setup Migrations and Seed via (Migrations and Seeding under Identity and Security) in ASP.NET MVC 5 Fundamentals by Scott Allen
Add Folder DataContexts to CC.Web
Add OrderDb.cs that derives from DbContext, use CC.Model.Order to create dbset
Enable Migrations
PM> enable-migrations - ContextTypeName OrderDb -MigrationsDirectory DataContexts\OrderDbMigrations
That should build Configurations.cs … add seed to that
Add Migration
PM> add-migration -ConfigurationTypeName CC.Web.DataContexts.OrderDbMigrations.Configuration "Initial Create"
Update Database
PM> update-database -ConfigurationTypeName CC.Web.DataContexts.OrderDbMigrations.Configuration

So I did all that… then figured out that if I take the Configuration.cs file it created and point that to CC.DataAccess.CodeCamperDbContext… I could get things to work as I expected… so went with that… I had to delete all the Migrations and start again… but that works…

Then Add the seed to Orders in the Configuration… update-database and it'll run the seed…
Now run the site, go to http://localhost:45095/breeze/breeze/orders and see the data… FINALLY….

Now… I need to re-work the angular side… get bootstrap 3 going… blah blah… but I had a lot of that going…

Now Angular code mods…
First the icons… then the stuff in layout (go through all files and put new display text up)
Now add a new menu item Orders (copy the folder Session and start the rename of stuff…)
Add the 3 routes to config.route.js

Fix stuff until it works…

Now at some point the old data stopped working, it may have been the migrations stuff… but when it stopped I decided to the the db out of the ce crap.
First I attached Person to Order and updated the seed.
